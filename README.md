# sdl-test
Just a barebones SDL2 OpenGL application.  Mostly for my future reference.

# Building

```
cmake .
make
```

# Running
`assets/` needs to be in the current working directory.
```
./SDL2Test
```

# Controls
`w` move forward

`s` move backward

`a` move left

`d` move right

`e` and `space` move up

`q` and `lshift` move down

`mouse` look around
